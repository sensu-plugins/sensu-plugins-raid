## [Unreleased]
- fixed software raid check (@corro)

## [2.0.1] - 2017-01-31
### Security
- updated rubocop dependency to `~> 0.51.0` per: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8418. (@majormoses)

### Changed
- appeased the cops (@majormoses)

## [2.0.0] - 2017-12-28
### Breaking Change
- `check-raid.rb`: added option `--log` with a default of `false` to prevent it default creating a log which is frequently being written to and filling up the disk. This does the *opposite* of what the vendor defaults are but due to the nature of those running it through a monitoring solution like sensu the defaults do not make sense in this use case. If you are wanting those logs you can change this to `true` to keep existing behavior. (@dhpowrhost) (@smbambling)
